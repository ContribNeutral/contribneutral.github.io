      <h4>The Software Ecosystem</h4>
      <h6 class="docs-header">Ecosystems</h6>
      <p>An ecosystem is an interconnected system of independent parts. A source of energy drives the system. Producers convert that energy into a form that can be used by themselves and others. Consumers use the outputs of producers, the producers themselves, and other consumers to drive their own activities. Consumers, in turn, provide raw materials that producers can use, and help to ensure that the population of producers and consumers is consistent with the resources available.</p>
      <p>In a healthy ecosystem, the consumers, producers, and resources in the environment interact in balance with each other. But an ecosystem can easily fall out of balance. Remove a critical piece of the system, or introduce a new participant, and an ecosystem can collapse - or find a new, unhealthy equilibrium.</p>

      <h6 class="docs-header">The Software Ecosystem</h6>
      <p>Software is an ecosystem. Creative energy drives producers to write new software, and to maintain existing software. That software is consumed by users to solve problems, and by developers who produce other software. The use of that software generates revenue which can be used to pay for the development of more software.</p>
      <p>However - the software ecosystem is not, at present, a healthy ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that Open Source tools and libraries are critical to the health of many businesses, and to the success of the software ecosystem as a whole, those who consume Open Source software do not generally contribute back to the ecosystem. They are deriving huge benefits and thriving personally, but they're not contributing back to the ecosystem in a way that allows producers - who are essential for their own prosperity - to survive and thrive.</p>
      <p>And there are plenty of indicators of this imbalance. Burnout is a <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/" rel="nofollow">prevalent</a> <a href="https://events.drupal.org/vienna2017/sessions/open-source-burnout" rel="nofollow">feature</a> of <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kytrinyx/the-bait-and-switch-of-open-source" rel="nofollow">Open Source</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonCropp/status/1166100939792474112" rel="nofollow">communities</a>. And as a result, <a href="http://heartbleed.com/" rel="nofollow">critical bugs emerge</a>, or maintainers <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm" rel="nofollow">withdraw their work and cause major disruptions</a>.</p>
      <p>The problem has been <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/" rel="nofollow">researched and documented</a>, but this knowledge has not caused significant change in business practices. Attempts to <a href="https://feross.org/introducing-thanks/" rel="nofollow">raise awareness of the problem</a> are met with antipathy. Mechanisms exist to allow conusmers to return revenue in the <a href="https://patreon.com" rel="nofollow">form</a> <a href="https://opencollective.com/" rel="nofollow">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">donations</a>, or to facilitate <a href="https://tidelift.com" rel="nofollow">support contracts</a>, but the vast majority of these efforts are <a href="https://staltz.com/software-below-the-poverty-line.html" rel="nofollow">unable to lift maintainers above the level of a poverty wage</a>. Attempts to <a href="https://feross.org/funding-experiment-recap/" rel="nofollow">force the issue</a> has been met with hostility. The software ecosystem has resources - but we haven't been successful in encouraging those who are consuming software to contribute back to the ecosystem.</p>
      <p>So how can we raise awareness of the problem - and more importantly - generate change?</p>
      <h6 class="docs-header">Carbon Neutrality</h6>
      <p>The situation in software is comparable to the situation with humanity's response to climate change. Over the centuries, the nature of human activity has changed. On an individual scale, the impact of lighting a campfire or cutting down a tree is miniscule; but when that activity is scaled up to modern industrial scale, human activity has a measurable effect on the Earth's ecosystem. Modern human activity has introduced an imbalance by extracting resources in an unsustainable way, and producing pollutants at a scale the ecosystem cannot absorb. We need to change the way we live - or we risk the collapse of our natural ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Carbon emmissions are the largest contributor to climate change; and so, one of the responses has been the emergence of the <span class="carbon">Carbon Neutrality</span> movement. This movement aims to halt the impact of human activity on climate by encouraging a reduction in harmful activities. Where reduction isn't possible, the use of mitigation strategies to offset the impact of those activities.</p>
      <p>The term "<span class="carbon">Carbon Neutral</span>" provides rallying cry for those advocating for change; it provides an indication of the type of change that is required; and it provides a measurable and achievable goal. Businesses can indicate their commitment to addressing climate change by adopting a <span class="carbon">Carbon Neutrality</span> pledge, and reporting on their efforts to meet and exceed the requirements of that pledge. Consumers can use these pledges as part of their process of deciding which businesses to support.</p>
      <h6 class="docs-header">How does this relate to software?</h6>
      <p>The maintenance crisis in Open Source is the software ecosystem's "climate change". Over the last 40 years, we've seen more and more software that we rely upon become Open Source software. This software is made freely available to consumers, and this has lead to extraordinary opportunities and growth in the number of consumers. Developers and their investors have generated extraordinary amounts of revenue by consuming Open Source software. But those producing Open Source software are struggling to find the resources they need to develop and maintain the software that has been the source of so much prosperity in the consumers.</p>
      <p>We don't want to change the compact around how people access Open Source software. The fact that foundational software is  freely available for use and modification by anyone has been instrumental in the rapid evolution of the software ecosystem.</p>
      <p>But we <em>do</em> need to change the relationship that consumers of Open Source software have with the producers of that software.</p>
      <p>The people that produce open source software are often called Contributors.</p>
      <p>We need the software ecosystem to become <span class="cn">Contributor Neutral</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="docs-section" id="meaning">
      <h4>What does it mean to be Contributor Neutral?</h4>
      <p>
      <p><span class="carbon">Carbon Neutralilty</span> is a commitment to critically analyzing and monitoring your activity to ensure that the value you extract from the ecosystem is met with an equal and opposite commitment to give back to that ecosystem. That can be done by reducing usage or offseting; either way, the aim is to have a "net zero" impact on climate change.</p>
      <p>Being <span class="cn">Contributor Neutral</span> means much the same, but to the software ecosystem. It's a commitment to be aware of how much Open Source software you use, and the relationship you have with those producers. It means trying to be part of the contribution process. And, when you aren't able to be actively involved in contribution yourself, it means offseting your consumption by providing resources to those are <em>are</em> contributing.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="docs-section" id="how">
        <h4>How do I become Contributor Neutral?</h4>

        <h6 class="docs-header">Acknowledgement</h6>
        <p>The first step is to acknowledge the issue. Talk with your colleagues and peers about the problem. Talk about the Open Source software that you use, and how that software is produced and maintained.</p>

        <p>Be aware of the software you are using - directly, and indirectly. You may be writing a website, and using a web server - but what software does that web server depend on? What software do the team developing that software depend on?</p>

        <h6 class="docs-header" >Contribute</h6>
        <p>Get involved in open source projects. If you're a business owner, give your employees time to contribute to the projects you use - even if those contributsion don't directly benefit you as a business.</p>

        <h6  class="docs-header" >Offset</h6>
        <p>Pledge to the Patreon or GitHub Sponsors of individual maintainers.
        <p>Donate or become members of Open Source foundations like the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/donations/">Python Software Foundation</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/donate/">Django Software Foundation.</a></p>

        <p>Purchase support contracts or memberships from organizations that produce open source software, or from groups that aggregate those support requests like <a href="https://tidelift.com/">Tidelift.</a></p>

        <h6 class="docs-header" >Advocacy</h6>
        <p>Talk about your commitment to be <span class="cn">Contributor Neutral</span>. Ask your suppliers or employers if they will adopt the <span class="cn">Contributor Neutral</span> pledge. Tell your suppliers that <span class="cn">Contributor Neutrality</span> is a factor in your purchasing decisions.</p>
